    "      > Each table represents a different kind of \"relation\" between bits of data.\n",
    "    \n",
    " - Each of the tables has many **rows** (sometimes called \"relations\").  For instance, each row of the `Employees` table represents information about a single employee:  \n",
    " \n",
    "      > Elements of a single column are _homogeneous_ (of the same kind, or data type) but apply to _different logical entities_.\n",
    "      \n",
    " - The information about a single employee is spread amongst the **columns** of the table:\n",
    " \n",
    "      > Elements of a single row are _heterogeneous_ but apply to _a single logical entity_.\n",
    "      \n",
    " - It is good practice to be able to specify each row of each table by a **primary key**: that is by some column, or small combination of columns, that uniquely specifies the row.  The columns `employee_id`, `task_id`, and `assignment_id` are all of this type.  This way, if you want to refer to this row in another table you can do it succinctly by this primary key.  SQL enforces uniqueness of the primary key.\n",
    "      \n",
    "**Examples:** here are some examples of \"relations\" (rows) that occur in practice:\n",
    "1. Storing one-to-one pieces of data for some sort of object: i.e. for each employee we store one name and one phone number; for each project we store one deadline and one description\n",
    "1. Storing one-to-many or many-to-many bits of data: i.e. if we needed to be able to store _many_ phone numbers for each employee, we'd have a new table `Employee_Phone_Numbers` with columns `employee_id` and `phone_number` (the two together can be a _composite primary key_).\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Anti-examples:** alternate, but **worse**, ways to do it would be: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Adding columns to the `Employees` table for `phone_number_1` to `phone_number_10`.  This is bad because it makes it hard to query against the phone numbers and is inflexible if you want to change the number of phone numbers.  In the _object oriented_ or _key-value_ you could simply make phone_numbers a list or array, and all would be well -- this is not available in the relational model. \n",
    "1. Having the `Employee_Phone_Numbers` table duplicate the employee name and other information.  This is bad because duplication of information across tables wastes space and can lead to update errors.\n",

    "SELECT expression1, expression2, ... FROM table_name [WHERE condition] [GROUP BY columns] [ORDER BY columns] [LIMIT number];\n",
    "```\n",

    "Brackets denote parts which are optional.  We'll explain everything except for `GROUP BY`.  Let us explain the parts:\n",
    "   1. __\"Expressions\": __\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The basic example is just a column name.  Another example is the placeholder `*`: it indicates _all_ columns.  You can also perform arithmetic (e.g. `column_1 + column_2`) and similar minor operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. __`WHERE` (\"condition\"):__\n",
    "   \n",
    "   An example would be `column_name = value`, and for partial string matches there is a special operator `LIKE`.  You can combine these with the usual binary operators (AND, OR) and parentheses for grouping.\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. __`ORDER BY` (sorting):__\n",
    "   \n",
    "   You can add a `SORT BY column_name1, column_name2, ...` to sort the results by the given column (applied in left-to-right order).  By default the sorting is ascending.  If you want it to be descending write e.g. `column_name1 DESC` (you can also write `ASC` for ascending to disambiguate).\n",
    " \n",
    "   1. __`LIMIT`:__\n",
    "   \n",
    "   If you want to just get at most the first N rows that would be returned, add on `LIMIT N`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   1. __`AS` (named expressions):__\n",
    "   \n",
    "   You can specify new names for the expressions that you're selecting.  This is especially useful when you're using aggregate functions: \n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT SUM(salary) as 'Total Salary' FROM ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "  \n",
    "Finally two remarks: SQL is not case sensitive.  It is just common to use all-caps for the commands, and normal case for table / column names.  It is also whitespace and new-line insensitive, so you can format your commands on multiple lines as you please.\n",

    "**Pros**\n",
    " - It operates on a single flat file on disk, which you can treat like any other file -- copy, scp, rename, etc.\n",
    " - It is a single small executable, comes pre-installed on many things, and doesn't require running a server.\n",
    " - Extensible (by C code).  It's open source and is small enough to be easy to modify it / write extension modules in C.\n",
    " - It has a quick and permissive (of errors) CSV loader, and doesn't stress correctness of schemas.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**\n",
    " - It lacks some useful \"advanced\" features (in particular, JOINs in UPDATEs have to be faked via subqueries and/or temporary tables).  The workarounds are generally slower than the \"right\" approach would be.\n",
