The promoter demonstrates a fixed portion of the circuit which is not reconfigured; 3: on the lower right is a library of two genes, enclosed by attB sites; 4: the configuration step involves mutating the unique overlap regions of the attP sites to match the attB sites in the genes to be inserted; 5: the recombination step involves inducing lambda phage Integrase (Int) (not shown), integrating the genes into the chromosome in the designated locations, such that the four numbered overlap regions match (1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2). Note the attachment sites becomes attL and attR sites; 6: top right figure shows a testbed circuit constructed for the BioFPGA project which will allow a GFP gene to be configured to be always on or function as an inverter when induced with AHL.\"/></a><h2><a href=\"/technologies/14044_biofpga-a-reconfigurable-chassis\">BioFPGA: A Reconfigurable Chassis</a></h2><p><strong>14044</strong> \\u2013 <span>   \\n\\n This invention is a reconfigurable chassis that\\nallows for rapid construction and optimization of biocircuits. \\n\\n  \\n\\n Technologies for cloning and recombination of genetic material are\\ntime-consuming and rate-limiting.

It's so common that there are two special convenience languages for such traversals: [CSS selectors](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp) and [XPath](http://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_intro.asp) (which works for all XML, not just HTML). We'll be using CSS selectors, which are more common for HTML and easier to learn.\n",

    "\n",
    " - `'mytag'` picks out all tags of type `mytag`.\n",
    " - `'#myid'` picks out all tags whose _id_ is equal to `myid`\n",
    " - `'.myclass'` picks out all tags whose _class_ is equal to `myclass`\n",
    " - `'mytag#myid'` will pick all tags of type `mytag` **and** `id` equal to `myid` (analogously for `'mytag.myclass'`)\n",
    " - If `'selector1'` and `'selector2'` are two selectors, then there is another selector `'selector1 selector2'`.  It picks out all tags satisfying `selector2` that are __descendents__(*) of something satisfying `selector1`, i.e. it's like our nested find.\n",
    " \n",
    " (*) It doesn't have to be a _direct_ descendent.  I.e. it can be a grand-grand-...-grand-child of something satisfying `selector1`.  For direct descendents we'd instead write `'selector1 > selector2'`\n",

    "1. You can limit your crawls through specifying the class property `allowed_domains` and definte the starting point of your crawl using the class property `start_urls`.\n",
    "1. You can also build pipelines of crawling and data extraction steps to make sure crawling code more usable.\n",
    "1. Additional scraping steps (e.g. scraping entries in a directory like in the example above) can be accessed via `scrapy.Request`.\n",
    "1. It has command lines arguements to allow you to interactively play with the the `response` object from a webpage (`scrapy shell`) or view a page as the library renders it, which may be different from how your browser renders it (`scrapy view`).\n",

If we were to run the above test twice, we'd probably find that some of the failures were just due to a connection error.  We didn't notice this because the _outer_ `try` / `except` is also catching these.  So: Modify `get_tech_details` to allow up to 3 retries. <br/>Bonus points if you actually look at what exceptions `urllib` throws in those cases instead of a general catch-all mechanism.  Alternate type of bonus points if you figure out how to do it using the `retrying` package.  You can test these by throttling your internet on and off to simulate an unreliable connection."
