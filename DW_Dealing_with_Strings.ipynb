    "Regular expressions provide a very concise way of specifying _sets of strings_ from a few building blocks and operations.  It is good to think of a regular expression as a special type of program that tries to \"eat\" a string, but is picky about what it eats.  For a given regular expression, the \"set of strings\" mentioned earlier consists of those strings that it's willing to eat.  The more formal word for this is **matches**: A regular expression *matches* some set of strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some building blocks that apply to matching a single character:\n",
    "  - `.` : Matches any character (except a newline)\n",
    "  - `\\s`: Matches any whitespace character (`\\S` is the opposite)\n",
    "  - `\\d`: Matches any digit (`\\D` is the opposite)\n",
    "  - `\\w`: Matches any alphanumeric character (`\\W` is the opposite)\n",
    "  - `c` : Matches the character 'c' (and similarly for all characters that don't have some special meaning like `.` or `\\` or `[`)\n",
    "  - `[   ]`: Lists of characters, with ranges allowed: e.g. `[a-zA-Z0-9]` is the same as `\\w` in ordinary ASCII\n",
    "  - `[^  ]`: Some characters have special meaning inside brackets, for instance the caret `^` indicates negation.  That is: `[^a-zA-Z0-9]` matches everything _other than_ what [a-zA-Z0-9] matches.\n",
    "  - `$`: Matches the end of the string (or right before a newline)\n",
    "  \n",
    "Now the fun comes in when we build in notation for repetition and concatenation:\n",
    "  - `AB`: If `A` and `B` are regular expressions, then a string $s$ will match `AB` if and only if it is the concatenation $s = s_A s_B$ of a string $s_A$ matching `A` with a string $s_B$ matching `B`.  In other words, `A B` will eat a string only if it can first let `A` eat some amount and then let `B` eat from what's left over -- and they must both be happy with what they get.\n",
    "  - `*`: If `A` is any regular expression, then `A*` matches any number of repetitions of A.\n",
    "  - `+`: ... matches one or more repetitions.\n",
    "  - `?`: ... matches 0 or 1 repetitions.\n",
    "  - `{m,n}`: ... matches between m and n repetitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python implements regular expressions in the re library.  You should know:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `re.match` requires that the match begin at the start of the string (though it need not eat all the way to the end).  This is not the \"normal\" behavior for regular expression libraries, which allow the match to begin anywhere: `re.search` gives this behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `re.match` returns a \"match object\".  It is not just a boolean value, but it _is_ \"truthy\" which is why we could write `if m:`\n"
